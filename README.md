## Install binary for your OS (now for every OS)
### [Latest Binary Releases](https://github.com/aerth/go-quitter/releases)


## Install from Go source

If you have Go toolchain installed you can install with:

```shell
GOPATH=/tmp/go go get -v -u github.com/aerth/go-quitter
sudo mv /tmp/go/bin/go-quitter /usr/local/bin/
```

Or git checkout the `develop` branch
```shell
GOPATH=/tmp/go go get -v -u github.com/aerth/go-quitter
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/aerth/go-quitter
git pull origin develop
go build
./go-quitter help
```


## Configure

To avoid storing the password in plaintext, go-quitter saves an encrypted config file at ~/.go-quitter, if it gets messed up just delete it and make a new one. You can switch config files on the fly using the environmental variable GNUSOCIALPATH.

```
go-quitter config
GNUSOCIALPATH=gnusocial.de go-quitter config
GNUSOCIALPATH=gnusocial.no go-quitter config
GNUSOCIALPATH=gnusocial.se go-quitter config

```

Next time you run it, it will ask for the password you set on the last step of config creation.


## Use in scripts


For automation, scripts, and cronjobs, you may want to delete config file and use environmental variables instead. Something likeâ€¦

```
// cat ~/.shrc || cat ~/.zshrc || cat ~/.bashrc || cat ~/.whatrc
export GNUSOCIALUSER=yourname
export GNUSOCIALPASS=yourpass
export GNUSOCIALNODE=gnusocial.de

// then run this command so you dont have to log out and back in.
. ~/.shrc


// make sure you chmod your shell rc file if shared machine.
chmod o-r ~/.shrc
chmod g-r ~/.shrc

## Usage

When running go-quitter with no arguments, a list of commands is printed.
For more information, run `go-quitter help`

```shell

$ go-quitter read // public timeline
$ go-quitter home // home timeline
$ go-quitter search // enters search mode
$ go-quitter post \!group \#hashtag \#EscapeSymbolsWithABackslash

```shell
#!/bin/sh                                                                       
unset GNUSOCIALNODE
